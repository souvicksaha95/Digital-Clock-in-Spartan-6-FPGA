# Digital-Clock-in-Spartan-6-FPGA
Digital Clock coded in Verilog. Simulated in iverilog. Implemented on Xilinx Spartan 6 FPGA and seven-segment display.
In the current code, the time will show as MM: SS (max goes upto 59:59)format and will reset at the end of the 59th minute. But that can be changed easily to more traditional format by instantiating hours module and adding two more seven-segment displays.
